- Notes:
	 - We are easily Lost in Thoughts. (p119)

	 - **"Wondering Mind is an unhappy mind."** (p119)
		 - When our minds wondering, we are less happy.

		 - Wondering Minds affects the default mode network(DMN) in our brain, which influences our capacity of "self-representation". (p120)
			 - Pay attention outwardly; Mindfulness and Metta helps reduce DMN; thinking about oneself increases DMN. es DMN.

	 - 5 mins per day for 5 weeks of meditation practice can benefit one's positive emotions. (p122)

	 - Mindfulness benefits both mental and physical health- *i.e. Blood Pressure, Immune System...* (p122)

	 - Pure Consciousness is apart from the five senses. (p127)

	 - Consciousness is the prior condition of every experience; the self or ego is an illusory appearance within it; (p129)
		 - 意识是每一次经验的先决条件，self or ego 只是其中一种虚幻的表象。

		 - what's the difference between Self and Ego, cos they are kinds same in Chinese?  `#❓question`

	 - is that thinking about what is beyond thought is still thinking? (p133) `#❓question`

	 - in Dzogchen, one “takes the goal as the path”, because what one’s looking for is the very thing that one practices. The goal of Dzogchen, is to grow familiar with this way of being in the world. (p134)
		 - 感觉这个related to **journey before destination.**

		 - Having No Head.

	 - If we only focus on the great details of the world, we’ll see our true face. Most meditations hope to elaborate that. (p147)
		 - 他举的例子是：当我们望向窗外，可能看到的是景色，窗户=窗户；也可能看到自己的影子，窗户=镜子。很容易在这两者之间切换，但是很难同时看到。

	 - Unless a person spent time on seeking “self-transcendence dualistically”, otherwise, she’s unlikely to realize that **selflessness** is the answer to her search. (p148)
