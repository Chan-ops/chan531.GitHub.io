	  - #[[Permanent Notes]]   [[Focus on things that you can control]].
	- Metta; Time Management? or be mindful with your time; be positive. 
	  
	  	 - #[[Literature Notes]] the key concept of Stoicism is: ^^Know what you can and can't control, then focus on things that you can control. ^^
		- This can be Summarised in 3 aspects: 
		  1. You can't control how others treat you, but you can control share your love and kindness to others; (metta)
		  2. You can't control your life span or time, but you can control how to spend your time;
		  3. You can't control bad things happen or not, but you can control how to think about it.

		  - #[[Fleeting Notes]]: Design can change our mindset of using an app.
	- Design is a form of Visual Language, and language can change our thinking(Linguistic Relativity)- how we think about things. so this is relevant to ((69b9a832-8e05-40a6-9150-7c45ddfb2a38))
	- I'm thinking about why back to use roam constantly. I tried Obsidian, craft, and recently-Logseq. they are all great apps, but why I keep going back to roam? I guess that's because it's more like my thinking process? both Obsidian and craft are too "elegant" to me, but in roam, i just dump everything here. it also triggers me to write more. 可能是因为我的很多想法和信息都是偏向于碎片化的，而Roam就像是一个私人Twitter一样，我可以将自己脑海中的碎片放到这里来。但Obsidian或者Craft不是，它们更适合长篇内容的人书写。这大概和它们的设计有关系。Roam是Block形式的，信息以这样的形式存在。而虽然Obsidian和craft都有link blocks的能力，可它们的界面却还是以Page存在的，所以会有一种不适合碎片信息的感觉。
	  
	  - #[[Permanent Notes]]    [[You can Pursue Happiness by Having LESS]]. 
	  	 - #[[Literature Notes]] In this Capitalist World, we have this mindset: To be happy, You need more. But in the Monk world, their mindset is the opposite: **by having less, you can pursue Happiness. ** which is and should be the healthier mindset.
		- But how to practice this "Less is More" mindset? #questions
		- This is because, **having less means less things, then less responsibilities or problems.** For instance, problems with hair could be: which shampoo I should use? which barber shop I should go? which hair style I should have? etc. These are problems only caused by Hair.
		- Reference Notes:  [Why LESS is MORE | A Monk Explains Minimalism - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h71kUZBoD2s&t=27s)
			- to think about: **What Don't I need? **
			- 1:07 in this Capitalist world, we have this mindset that **to be happy, you need more.**
			- 1:37 in the Monk world, what they pursue happiness is the Opposite -> LESS.
			- **Less things= less problems and responsibilities. **
				- 3:16 by having less, you have less responsibilities on things, then you have more time, on practice yourself, like meditation.
				- 6:05 He gave an Example of it about hair. 7:24 about clothing...
			- 4:09  the Difference between Monks and Lay people is: Precepts. (准则；格言)
				- in the lay life, you can do anything under the Law. you can eat anything, eat at anytime you want.
