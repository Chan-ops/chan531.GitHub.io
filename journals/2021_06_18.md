- Import
	 - [[非暴力沟通]]

- #[[Fleeting Notes]] If you know information about something, that's knowledge; if you continuously practice these knowledge on yourself, that's Wisdom. 
	 - I have this idea from [[June 17th, 2021]]'s notes on Stoicism and Less is more. Because they are easy to understand and remember, but difficult to practice. lol, I don't even know how to practice. So I think find a way to practice them is more important to just talk about it.

	 - You'll never be mindful unless you practice mindfulness; you'll never become a Minimalist unless you practice minimalism. Same for my own practice: You'll never be an Artist unless you practice Art.

	 - **gratitude journal: i am grateful for... **

	 - **the good you see in others**

		 - what can I learn from this person. 

	 - **shadow journal**
		 - anger; ego&pride; Jealousy; Greed(贪婪); Manipulation. 

	 - **venting journal**
		 - more like a brain dump. 

	 - **meditation journal**
		 - what did I do before meditation?

		 - how I feel after today's meditation?

- DONE 想要弄一个🌞 I WANNA… 的Page，有点像Bucket List的感觉，或者是对自己Focus的一个核心吧。就是我想成为什么？比如说I wanna have a happy mind，就可以在下面Link Mental Health这个page。这个I WANNA，可以是I wanna be…； I wanna do… etc。 #facebooktoroam 
	 - Also, how about a "👀 I AM..." Page？ 因为上面一个是“我想成为什么？“，而I AM则关注在”现在的我“。不知道这样会不会比较有用？但是我觉得可以试试呢。

	 - 比如：((82e75e55-f6d7-4de7-9ed7-0343bb223f88))

- #[[Reference Notes]] [声东击西: #169 研究了多年传播，热爱综艺的学者一块聊了聊 (1h17m)](https://castro.fm/episode/OJhWyB)
	 - 52:37 有一本书推荐：文本盗猎者。 关于参与式文化。

	 - 资本与人（个体）的关系；**资本与大众文化的关系**。可以了解一下呢。

	 - 1:14:00 精英文化对大众文化的侵蚀。这些看似“不正经”的东西却有极大的文化意义。 

- i hope every notes are resonate or useful or mean something to me, so I put **why?** (eg. [[Why Read this book? ]] | [[Why this important to me? ]]) in every notes, and see how the answers are connected with [[👀 I AM...]]and [[🌞 I WANNA…]].
